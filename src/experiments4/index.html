      1. The family Ursidae is one of nine families in the suborder
      Caniformia, or "doglike" carnivorans, within the order Carnivora.
      Bears' closest living relatives are the pinnipeds, canids, and
      musteloids.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Modern bears comprise eight species in three subfamilies:
      Ailuropodinae (monotypic with the giant panda), Tremarctinae
      (monotypic with the spectacled bear), and Ursinae (containing
      six species divided into one to three genera, depending on
      the authority)
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Nuclear chromosome analysis show that the karyotype of the
      six ursine bears is nearly identical, with each having 74
      chromosomes (see Ursid hybrid), whereas the giant panda has
      42 chromosomes and the spectacled bear 52
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The earliest members of Ursidae belong to the extinct subfamily
      Amphicynodontinae, including Parictis (late Eocene to early
      middle Miocene, 38–18 Mya) and the slightly younger
      Allocyon (early Oligocene, 34–30 Mya), both from North America
    </p>
    <p>
      5. These animals looked very different from today's bears,
      being small and raccoon-like in overall appearance, with
      diets perhaps more similar to that of a badger
    </p>
    <p>
      6. European genera morphologically very similar to Allocyon,
      and to the much younger American Kolponomos (about 18 Mya),
      are known from the Oligocene, including Amphicticeps
      and Amphicynodon.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. There has been various morphological evidence linking
      amphicynodontines with pinnipeds, as both groups were
      semi-aquatic, otter-like mammals.
    </p>
    <p>
      8.  In addition to the support of the pinniped–amphicynodontine
      clade, other morphological and some molecular evidence
      supports bears being the closet living relatives to pinnipeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. The raccoon-sized, dog-like Cephalogale is the oldest-known
      member of the subfamily Hemicyoninae, which first
      appeared during the middle Oligocene in Eurasia about 30 Mya.
